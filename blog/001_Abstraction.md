# Abstraction
Language is a very powerful tool. It allows us to describe the world around us, express our ideas, and reveal ourselves to others. Programming languages aren't nearly as powerful as Natural languages, but they still allow us to perform the same faculties: describe the world, express ideas, and reveal truth. They just do so within the framework of Mathematics. But isn't Mathematics just another language? Do we not use Mathematics to describe the world, to express ideas, and to reveal truth? It would seem to me that Mathematics is just another language, but it is a different type of language than the Natural languages that we are most accumstomed to. Mathematics is a language of Abstractions. We can observe that when two people gather into a family and have a baby, they become a family of three. This transformation of the loving family of two into a growing family of three can be abstracted into the concept of addition. Mathematics does this through the use of the *addition operator:* `+`.
