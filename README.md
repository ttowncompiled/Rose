# Rose
Rose is an up-and-coming procedural programming language that is being designed by yours truly. She has a three core focuses: to implement OOP using a Rusty-approach to RAII, to improve polymorphic dispatch using an expressive taxonomy of OO relationships, and to employ a macro assertion library which can leverage behavioral abstractions to enforce run-time invariants. She believes that abstractions should be powerful, not restrictive, that they should come with no additional overhead, and that they should be just as good as if they were implemented by hand. Rose is inspired by other procedural languages such as Rust, Julia, Ruby, Go, Java, JavaScript, and Eiffel.
