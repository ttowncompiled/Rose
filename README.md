# Rose
A new Object-Oriented programming language that focuses on composition. This language will focus on RAII, pure functions, strict Is-a and Has-a composition, lazy composition, and more. The syntax and semantics are inspired by languages such as Crystal, Julia, and Rust. The language will be built on top of the LLVM.
